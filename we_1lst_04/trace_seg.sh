# This script will stitch together a trajectory file from your Amber-WESTPA
# simulation that can be viewed in VMD or another molecular dynmaics 
# visualization software.  Run this script with the command ./amberTraj.sh
# from the same directory where the west.h5 file from your WESTPA simulation
# is located.  The results of this analysis will be stored in a new folder
# called trajAnalysis as the file trace.nc.  Load trace.nc into VMD to 
# visualize the trajectory.  As a note, you will need to have your computer
# configured to run w_succ from the WESTPA software package and cpptraj from 
# the Amber software package. Though, if the simulation has completed successfully,
# these commands will most likely be ready to run.
